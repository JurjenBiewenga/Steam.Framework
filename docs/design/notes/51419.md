# summary

 * [repository laytout](#repository-layout): monorepo

 * [library and runtime targets](#library-and-runtime-targets): lowest possible .NET Standard, multitargetting with .NET Standard 2.0 when applicable

 * [lang version](#lang-version): 7.3

## repository layout

The framework contains many projects that depend on other projects in the framework. To speed up development and make it easier to make new features and libraries, the libraries and tests will be kept in the `Steam.Framework` repo. Samples, tools, and other code not related to the libraries will be kept in other repos across `steamframework`.

## library and runtime targets

Libraries should target the lowest possible .NET Standard as written in the [.NET Standard doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard). In the event a library targets .NET Standard 1.x, it should also multitarget with .NET Standard 2.0 to prevent dependency collisions.

When designing certain libraries, developers should keep in mind their audiences and the runtimes they may be used on. Limited runtimes such as Unity and CoreRT have limited reflection capabilities so, if libraries use reflection in their higher level APIs, they should provide other APIs that don't use reflection or similar systems.

## lang version

Libraries should use C# 7.3. At the time of this writing, C# 8 is in preview and some of its features are not supported in many runtimes. To maintain compatibility with as many runtimes as possible, we will be using C# 7.3. In the future we may discuss moving C# 8 to use some of its high sought features like nullable reference types, async streams, and ranges.
